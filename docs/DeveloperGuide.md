## **Acknowledgements**

Our project is built based on the foundation design and documentation structure of AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) by the SE-EDU team, as provided in the CS2103T module at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

We also referenced SE-EDU’s AB3 Developer Guide and Sample MarkBind sites for documentation and diagram formatting conventions.

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Alternative (arguably, a more OOP) models are given below. The diagram below has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

To fully visualise `PaymentList`, the `Student` holds a `PaymentList`. The `PaymentList` is associated with a `PaymentStatus` enum. This allows quick for quick `PaymentStatus` checks for a `Student` object.
<puml src="diagrams/PaymentClassDiagram.puml" width="250" />

In the same vein `Student` holds a `LessonList`, which contains any amount of `Lesson` as shown in the diagram below
<puml src="diagrams/LessonClassDiagram.puml" width="400" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Payment feature

The Payment feature allows tutors to automatically track and manage tuition fees for each student.
Each student has a PaymentList containing monthly Payment objects, which record the total and unpaid amounts for that month.
Whenever lessons are added, edited, or deleted, Tuiniverse automatically recalculates the corresponding monthly payment to keep all financial records consistent.

#### Proposed Implementation

* The Payment class stores details such as YearMonth, TotalAmount, and UnpaidAmount.
* The PaymentList aggregates all payments per student and provides utility methods such as calculateUnpaidAmount() and getTotalAmountFloat().
* The ModelManager maintains observable properties (totalEarningsProperty, totalUnpaidProperty) that automatically update whenever any student’s payment data changes in UI.
* Commands like PayCommand mark payments as settled, updating both the UI and underlying model in real time.

#### Design considerations:

### \[Implemented\] Monthly rollover feature

The Monthly Rollover feature automatically generates new monthly payment entries for each student when a new month begins.
This ensures tutors always start each month with up-to-date payment records without having to add them manually.

#### Proposed Implementation

* Implemented in ModelManager#rolloverMonthlyPayments() and invoked during app startup or when DateTimeUtil.currentYearMonth() differs from the last recorded month in UserPrefs.
* For each student, the system creates a new Payment entry for the current month based on their latest LessonList and carries over any unpaid balances from the previous month.
* The logic ensures idempotence (no duplicate months added).

#### Design considerations:

{ to be updated }

### \[Implemented\] Time clash feature

The Time Clash feature prevents tutors from scheduling overlapping lessons.
It checks for conflicts between lessons based on day and time intervals, ensuring that tutors can maintain an organized, non-overlapping schedule.

#### Proposed Implementation

* Implemented in the Lesson#hasTimeClash(Lesson otherLesson) method.
* The method returns true if two lessons occur on the same Day and their LessonTime intervals overlap.
* Used during AddLessonCommand to validate new lessons before insertion.
* Also leveraged by the lesson calendar to flag and highlight clashes visually in the UI.

## **Appendix: Effort**
### Difficulty level
Tuiniverse goes beyond AB3 in scope and architectural complexity. While AB3 manages a single entity type (Person),
Tuiniverse extends this to three distinct domain models — Student, Lesson, and Payment - that are all connected to
each other. Each entity has its own data structure (LessonList, PaymentList) and lifecycle logic
(e.g., monthly payment rollovers, lesson scheduling, payment tracking). This resulted in higher coupling and the need for
careful abstraction.

### Challenges faced
1. **Synchronising data across Student, Lesson, and Payment.**<br>
The value, or the TotalAmount, of each payment is dependent on the student's lessons. In turn, the payment status of
a student is dependent on the status of the payment list, which is dependent on the number of unpaid payments in the payment
list. Hence, a lot of abstraction was required to make sure information was passed accurately while still enforcing SLAP.
Furthermore, listeners were needed to make sure changes in Lesson were detected in Payment and Student. This made use of the observer
pattern to make sure other objects were aware of any mutation in state.

2. **Time-based architecture**<br>
A lot of Tuiniverse's logic is tightly coupled with time. For instance, the MonthlyRollover logic was needed to make sure a new
Payment object was instantiated with each month. This required careful time-based checking (via YearMonth) and persistence management to prevent
duplicate rollovers while maintaining data integrity.

3. **Dynamic payment status updates**<br>
Students may decide to add lessons in the middle of the month, which initially made it difficult to change payment status after paid. Hence,
refactoring payment to include unpaid amounts made it easier for tutors to check the amount unpaid for these new students.

4. **Effective scheduling**<br>
We wanted to make sure scheduling reflected in real life time management, where deconflicts are necessary and one cannot participate in
two events simultaneously. Hence, we added a method to assess for clashes. Furthermore, a lesson list panel was added to view a tutor's schedule for
the day, which can help them to plan accordingly.

### Effort required
A lot of our code was written from scratch, especially the MonthlyRollover and TimeClash logic. That said, some effort was saved through reuse of code,
namely in the adding, deleting, and editing lessons which mirrored the design of the AB3 add/delete/edit feature. We can confidently say
only about 10% of code was borrowed.

We split the responsibilities between our members by teams. Rachel and Ray handled the Lesson implementations, while Emilia and Bing Hang
worked on Payment. Dickson, aside from UI, took the lead in bridging the two teams, and took the initiative to ensure the deliverables were done correctly and on time.

The effort required from all 5 of us was high. Aside from the features we wanted to implement, there were several other responsibilities
we made sure to be attentive of, namely:
* Testing
* Code Quality
* Documentation
* UI design
* Project/GitHub management

We made sure to segment this effectively among the 5 of us, with each of us heading a different aspect. This allowed one person to take
responsibility for ensuring the quality of our code across the codebase, while adhering to software engineering practices.

### Achievement of the project
Tuiniverse successfully evolved AB3 into a feature-complete tuition management application handling different aspects of tutor-pupil management.
It enables private tutors to manage lessons, payments, and students in one place - with real-time financial tracking and automated rollovers.
Beyond technical achievement, the project demonstrates our team’s mastery of:
* Software design principles (abstraction, low coupling, high cohesion).
* Event-driven programming via JavaFX bindings.
* Test-driven development across multiple entity types.
* Collaborative Git workflows (feature branches, PR reviews, CI testing).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team Size: 5

### 1. Granular payment handling
At present, Tuiniverse assumes that once a student begins lessons in a given month, they attend for the entire month.
Consequently, the system calculates the total and unpaid fees based on a full month’s worth of lessons, even if the student
joined midway through the month.
In future iterations, we plan to enhance this by supporting partial payment calculations, allowing tutors to accurately account for students who begin
or pause lessons mid-month. This will be done by taking in the current date, and implementing a new CountDaysFromNowUntilMonthEnd method
which counts the number of a certain day (eg Thursday) until the end of the month.

### 2. Unselect a selected student
Currently, when a student is pressed, the person card will turn from light blue to bright blue. However, one is unable to unselect
this person card, and only press another person card to turn the card back to light blue. Hence in the future, we can implement an unselect
by counting for the number of clicks.

### 3. Adding tags
When editing a student to add tags, they currently need to retype every single tag to preserve the tags that were set previously, as a new
tag list will be created. Hence, in the future, we can create an add.tag function that adds a tag to a person in case they have additional
information they want to store.

### 4. Viewing lessons in order
When viewing a student's lesson via the view command, the lessons are sorted by time. This is not optimal, as we can see Thursday 6am lessons
ranked before Monday 8am lesson even if it is Monday. Hence, we can sort the student's lesson list first by day, then by time, instead of
by time only.

### 5. Duplicate tags
Adding/editing tags will only register one tag for the same tag instance (ie edit 1 t/tag t/tag only creates one tag tag). However, no error or
message in usage indicates that duplicates are not allowed. Hence, the message usage can be amended.

### 6. Custom Payment amount
Currently payCommand assumes student has paid his due fees all at once. In a future enhancement, tutor would be able to decrement unpaidAmount with a custom amount. 

### 7. Attendance list
Current implementation assumes that student attends all the lessons in the month, not accounting for public holidays and instances where student is absent. An attendance list where tutor can mark student's attendance will help solve the problem

### 8. Today's Schedule Not Showing Student Name
Currently, the lesson list panel displays the day’s lesson schedule but does not 
indicate which student each lesson is associated with. We plan to enhance this feature 
in the future by including the student’s name alongside each lesson, allowing users to 
easily identify which students they will be teaching for the day.

### 9. Add, Edit, and Delete Lesson UI
At present, when users add, edit, or delete a lesson, only a confirmation message 
appears in the message box to indicate that the command has been successfully executed.
In the future, we plan to improve the user experience by automatically switching the 
lesson panel to display the specific student’s lesson list, enabling users to immediately 
view the updates they have made.
