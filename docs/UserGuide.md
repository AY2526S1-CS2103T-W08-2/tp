## Introduction
As a **private secondary school tutor** in Singapore, it can be hard to **manage student contacts**,
**track payments** and **schedule lessons** with such a big group of people. Unless you are willing to fork out high prices for premium services meant
for larger tuition centre businesses, it means a lot of **unnecessary hassle** and much **room for error**. 

Tuiniverse is the solution for all things tuition!
Tuiniverse is a **desktop app** which <u>expedites</u>:
* Contact storing and upkeep
* Payment tracking
* Lesson scheduling

All of this is displayed done with optimized typing (via a Command Line Interface) layered within graphical
display of all the information you need.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>

Operating System | What to expect 
-----------------|------------------
Mac|  Follow the Java installation instructions [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
Windows| Follow the Java installation instructions [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html)
Linux | Follow the Java installation instructions [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html)


2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Tuiniverse app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tuiniverse.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

## Familarisation
To get adjusted to using Tuiniverse, we have created a short practice to keep users up to track on how to use the app.

Type some commands into the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

Some example commands you can try:
* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the contact list.

* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

* `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

* `exit` : Exits the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for more details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Tuiniverse home folder.
**Q**: How do I add a payment for a student?<br>
**A**: Our app handles the payment for you, add a payment for every month elapsed since you have opened the app.

**Q**: How do I edit only one tag for a specific student without affecting the others?<br>
**A**: You’ll need to specify both the edited tag and the tags you want to keep in order to see the changes.
For example, if a student currently has the tags `earlyLesson` and `moreExplanation`, and you
want to change `earlyLesson` to `lateLesson`, use the edit command as follows:
`edit [INDEX] t/lateLesson t/moreExplanation`

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
